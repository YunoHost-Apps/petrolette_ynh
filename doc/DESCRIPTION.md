Pétrolette is a news reader that doesn't know you

Pétrolette is fully self-contained, makes no external call whatsoever, and embarks a total of zero tracker or "analysis" tool. Needless to say she is also completely ad-free.

The application has 2 modes 
- multi user : each user store is own config itself.
- mono user : configuration is store locally in the server. Each visitor see the same page. 

For now, there is no any mechanism included for feed protection. Any visitor can modify the feed list.
